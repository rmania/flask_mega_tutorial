    In the send_email() function, the application instance is passed as
    an argument to a background thread that will then deliver the email
    without blocking the main application. Using current_app directly
    in the send_async_email() function that runs as a background thread
    would not have worked, because current_app is a context-aware
    variable that is tied to the thread that is handling the client
    request. In a different thread, current_app would not have a
    value assigned. Passing current_app directly as an argument to the
    thread object would not have worked either, because current_app is
    really a proxy object that is dynamically mapped to the
    application instance. So passing the proxy object would be the
    same as using current_app directly in the thread. What I needed
    to do is access the real application instance that is stored
    inside the proxy object, and pass that as the app argument.
    The current_app._get_current_object() expression extracts the
    actual application instance from inside the proxy object, so that
    is what I passed to the thread as an argument.
